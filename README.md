[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dart-lang/bazel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dart-lang/bazel)

[Bazel][bazel] support for [Dart][dart].

Bazel is a _correct, reproducible, and fast_ build tool used internally at
Google, and now open source, that provides a powerful and extensible framework
for building software and maintaining code.

## Why Bazel

Large applications in Google like [AdWords Next][blog-awn] and
[AdSense][blog-ads] have used Dart and [Angular Dart][angular-dart] in
production with Bazel for a while, and now we want to share Bazel with the rest
of the community.

## Getting Started

The `dazel` package publishes a `dazel` command that takes an existing pub
package and automatically generates a Bazel workspace: full of extensions,
macros, rules, and more.
